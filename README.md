# Usage

When running the script, you can pass 4 potential arguments:
Example: `python pywall.py -r 1920x1080 -c general -ar 16x9 -d wallpaper1`

1. **Category**

	- `--category` or `-c`
	- The category that the script will search in for your image.
	- Valid categories are `General`, `People`, `Anime`, and `All`.
	- When the argument is left blank, the search defaults to All.

2. **Save Directory**

	- `--directory` or `-d`
	- The directory in which to save the image.
	- When left blank, it will save in the local directory of the script.
	- This argument can also be used to just apply a filename, while saving it in the local directory. For example,
		
        `pyWall.py -c General -d image1`
        
        This will save the image as 'image1.png' in the local directory.
        
 3. **Resolution**
 	
    - `--resolution` or `-r`
    - Desired _exact_ resolution.
    - Use `--resolution_plus` or -`rp` to include available higher resolutions as well.
    - Example: `-r 2560x1440` or `-rp 1920x1080`

4. **Aspect Ratio**

	- `aspect-ratio` or `-ar`
	- Example: `-ar 16x9`

To have a new wallpaper on every boot (win 10):

Bring up the 'run' menu by pressing `win` + `R` on your keyboard and enter `shell:startup` to open the 'Startup' folder. Drop the script in this folder and it will run on every boot, giving you a new wallpaper every time.
